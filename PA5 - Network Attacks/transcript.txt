I've lost count of how many times I've needed to reset this for you...
I put the reset token in a file on my machine, and I spun up a quick webserver running if you want to wget it or whatever.
my IP address is 192.168.1.62, the webserver is running on port uh... something in the 9000 range, I don't remember.

seriously though you need to figure this out, one of the students might break in and hack something if you're not careful

ps also just to confirm, for the pa5 turnin A on gradescope, they need to submit the protocol transcript they used to send the email, right?
like the raw text request/responses between them and the server
