Hi mom,

Grad school is going well.  I'm just about to enter my 2nd year here as a PhD
student.  Security research is a ton of fun, and I'm excited that a paper I
helped write should soon be published in one of the top security conferences.
I hope to finish my coursework by the end of the year so I can focus full-time
on research.  Hang on, my advisor is calling, I'll be right back
